.. _development-workflow:

====================
Development workflow
====================

You already have your own forked copy of the NumPy_ repository, by
following :ref:`forking`, :ref:`set-up-fork`, you have configured git_
by following :ref:`configure-git`, and have linked the upstream
repository as explained in :ref:`linking-to-upstream`.

What is described below is a recommended workflow with Git.

Basic workflow
##############

In short:

1. Start a new *feature branch* for each set of edits that you do.
   See :ref:`below <making-a-new-feature-branch>`.

   Avoid putting new commits in your ``master`` branch.

2. Hack away! See :ref:`below <editing-workflow>`

3. Avoid merging other branches into your feature branch while you are
   working.

   You can optionally rebase if really needed,
   see :ref:`below <rebasing-on-master>`.

4. When finished:

   - *Contributors*: push your feature branch to your own Github repo, and
     :ref:`ask for code review or make a pull request <asking-for-merging>`.

   - *Core developers* (if you want to push changes without
     further review)::

         # First, either (i) rebase on upstream -- if you have only few commits
         git fetch upstream
         git rebase upstream/master

         # or, (ii) merge to upstream -- if you have many related commits
         git fetch upstream
	 git merge --no-ff upstream/master

         # Recheck that what is there is sensible
         git log --oneline --graph
         git log -p upstream/master..

         # Finally, push branch to upstream master
	 git push upstream my-new-feature:master

     See :ref:`below <pushing-to-main>`.

This way of working helps to keep work well organized and the history
as clear as possible.

.. note::

   Do not use ``git pull`` --- this avoids common mistakes if you are
   new to Git. Instead, always do ``git fetch`` followed by ``git
   rebase``, ``git merge --ff-only`` or ``git merge --no-ff``,
   depending on what you intend.

.. seealso::

   See discussions on `linux git workflow`_,
   and `ipython git workflow <http://mail.scipy.org/pipermail/ipython-dev/2010-October/006746.html>`__.

.. _making-a-new-feature-branch:

Making a new feature branch
===========================

::

   git branch my-new-feature
   git checkout my-new-feature

or just::

   git checkout -b my-new-feature upstream/master

Generally, you will want to keep this also on your public github_ fork
of NumPy_.  To do this, you `git push`_ this new branch up to your github_
repo.  Generally (if you followed the instructions in these pages, and
by default), git will have a link to your github_ repo, called
``origin``.  You push up to your own repo on github_ with::

   git push origin my-new-feature

In git >= 1.7 you can ensure that the link is correctly set by using the
``--set-upstream`` option::

   git push --set-upstream origin my-new-feature
   
From now on git_ will know that ``my-new-feature`` is related to the
``my-new-feature`` branch in your own github_ repo.


.. _editing-workflow:

The editing workflow
====================

Overview
--------

::

   # hack hack
   git add my_new_file
   git commit -am 'ENH: some message'

   # push the branch to your own Github repo
   git push

In more detail
--------------

#. Make some changes
#. See which files have changed with ``git status`` (see `git status`_).
   You'll see a listing like this one::

     # On branch my-new-feature
     # Changed but not updated:
     #   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
     #   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
     #
     #	modified:   README
     #
     # Untracked files:
     #   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
     #
     #	INSTALL
     no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

#. Check what the actual changes are with ``git diff`` (`git diff`_).
#. Add any new files to version control ``git add new_file_name`` (see
   `git add`_). 
#. To commit all modified files into the local copy of your repo,, do
   ``git commit -am 'A commit message'``.  Note the ``-am`` options to
   ``commit``. The ``m`` flag just signals that you're going to type a
   message on the command line.  The ``a`` flag - you can just take on
   faith - or see `why the -a flag?`_ - and the helpful use-case description in
   the `tangled working copy problem`_. The `git commit`_ manual
   page might also be useful.
#. To push the changes up to your forked repo on github_, do a ``git
   push`` (see `git push`). 


.. _rebasing-on-master:

Rebasing on master
==================

This updates your feature branch with changes from the upstream `NumPy
github`_ repo. If you do not absolutely need to do this, try to avoid
doing it, except perhaps when you are finished.

First, it can be useful to update your master branch::

   # go to the master branch
   git checkout master
   # pull changes from github
   git fetch upstream
   # update the master branch
   git rebase upstream/master
   # push it to your Github repo
   git push

Then, the feature branch::

   # go to the feature branch
   git checkout my-new-feature
   # make a backup in case you mess up
   git branch tmp my-new-feature
   # rebase on master
   git rebase master

If you have made changes to files that have changed also upstream,
this may generate merge conflicts that you need to resolve.::

   # delete backup branch
   git branch -D tmp

.. _recovering-from-mess-up:

Recovering from mess-ups
------------------------

Sometimes, you mess up merges or rebases. Luckily, in Git it is
relatively straightforward to recover from such mistakes.

If you mess up during a rebase::

   git rebase --abort

If you notice you messed up after the rebase::

   # reset branch back to the saved point
   git reset --hard tmp

If you forgot to make a backup branch::

   # look at the reflog of the branch
   git reflog show my-feature-branch

   8630830 my-feature-branch@{0}: commit: BUG: io: close file handles immediately
   278dd2a my-feature-branch@{1}: rebase finished: refs/heads/my-feature-branch onto 11ee694744f2552d
   26aa21a my-feature-branch@{2}: commit: BUG: lib: make seek_gzip_factory not leak gzip obj
   ...

   # reset the branch to where it was before the botched rebase
   git reset --hard my-feature-branch@{2}


.. _asking-for-merging:

Asking for your changes to be merged with the main repo
=======================================================

When you feel your work is finished, you can ask for code review, or
directly file a pull request.

Asking for code review
----------------------

#. Go to your repo URL - e.g. ``http://github.com/your-user-name/numpy``.
#. Click on the *Branch list* button:

   .. image:: branch_list.png

#. Click on the *Compare* button for your feature branch - here ``my-new-feature``:

   .. image:: branch_list_compare.png

#. If asked, select the *base* and *comparison* branch names you want to
   compare.  Usually these will be ``master`` and ``my-new-feature``
   (where that is your feature branch name).
#. At this point you should get a nice summary of the changes.  Copy the
   URL for this, and post it to the `NumPy mailing list`_, asking for
   review.  The URL will look something like:
   ``http://github.com/your-user-name/numpy/compare/master...my-new-feature``.
   There's an example at
   http://github.com/matthew-brett/nipy/compare/master...find-install-data
   See: http://github.com/blog/612-introducing-github-compare-view for
   more detail.

The generated comparison, is between your feature branch
``my-new-feature``, and the place in ``master`` from which you branched
``my-new-feature``.  In other words, you can keep updating ``master``
without interfering with the output from the comparison.  More detail?
Note the three dots in the URL above (``master...my-new-feature``) and
see :ref:`dot2-dot3`.

Filing a pull request
---------------------

When you are ready to ask for the merge of your code:

#. Go to the URL of your forked repo, say
   ``http://github.com/your-user-name/numpy.git``.
#. Click on the 'Pull request' button:

   .. image:: pull_button.png

   Enter a message; we suggest you select only ``NumPy`` as the
   recipient.  The message will go to the NumPy core developers.  Please
   feel free to add others from the list as you like.


.. _pushing-to-main:

Pushing changes to the main repo
================================

When you have a set of "ready" changes in a feature branch ready for
Numpy's ``master`` or ``maintenance/1.5.x`` branches, you can push
them to ``upstream`` as follows:

1. First, merge or rebase on the target branch.

   a) Only a few commits: prefer rebasing::

          git fetch upstream
	  git rebase upstream/master

      See :ref:`above <rebasing-on-master>`.

   b) Many related commits: consider creating a merge commit::

          git fetch upstream
	  git merge --no-ff upstream/master

2. Check that what you are going to push looks sensible::

       git log -p upstream/master..
       git log --oneline --graph

3. Push to upstream::

       git push upstream my-feature-branch:master

.. note::

   Avoid using ``git pull`` here.

Additional things you might want to do
######################################

.. _rewriting-commit-history:

Rewriting commit history
========================

.. note::

   Do this only for your own feature branches.

There's an embarassing typo in a commit you made? Or perhaps the you
made several false starts you would like the posterity not to see.

This can be done via *interactive rebasing*.

Suppose that the commit history looks like this::

    git log --oneline
    eadc391 Fix some remaining bugs
    a815645 Modify it so that it works
    2dec1ac Fix a few bugs + disable
    13d7934 First implementation
    6ad92e5 * masked is now an instance of a new object, MaskedConstant
    29001ed Add pre-nep for a copule of structured_array_extensions.
    ...

and ``6ad92e5`` is the last commit in the ``master`` branch. Suppose we
want to make the following changes:

* Rewrite the commit message for ``13d7934`` to something more sensible.
* Combine the commits ``2dec1ac``, ``a815645``, ``eadc391`` into a single one.

We do as follows::

    # make a backup of the current state
    git branch tmp HEAD
    # interactive rebase
    git rebase -i 6ad92e5

This will open an editor with the following text in it::

    pick 13d7934 First implementation
    pick 2dec1ac Fix a few bugs + disable
    pick a815645 Modify it so that it works
    pick eadc391 Fix some remaining bugs

    # Rebase 6ad92e5..eadc391 onto 6ad92e5
    #
    # Commands:
    #  p, pick = use commit
    #  r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
    #  e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
    #  s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
    #  f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
    #
    # If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
    # However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
    #

To achieve what we want, we will make the following changes to it::

    r 13d7934 First implementation
    pick 2dec1ac Fix a few bugs + disable
    f a815645 Modify it so that it works
    f eadc391 Fix some remaining bugs

This means that (i) we want to edit the commit message for
``13d7934``, and (ii) collapse the last three commits into one. Now we
save and quit the editor.

Git will then immediately bring up an editor for editing the commit
message. After revising it, we get the output::

    [detached HEAD 721fc64] FOO: First implementation
     2 files changed, 199 insertions(+), 66 deletions(-)
    [detached HEAD 0f22701] Fix a few bugs + disable
     1 files changed, 79 insertions(+), 61 deletions(-)
    Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/my-feature-branch.

and the history looks now like this::

     0f22701 Fix a few bugs + disable
     721fc64 ENH: Sophisticated feature
     6ad92e5 * masked is now an instance of a new object, MaskedConstant

If it went wrong, recovery is again possible as explained :ref:`above
<recovering-from-mess-up>`.

Deleting a branch on github_
============================

::

   git checkout master
   # delete branch locally
   git branch -D my-unwanted-branch
   # delete branch on github
   git push origin :my-unwanted-branch

(Note the colon ``:`` before ``test-branch``.  See also:
http://github.com/guides/remove-a-remote-branch


Several people sharing a single repository
==========================================

If you want to work on some stuff with other people, where you are all
committing into the same repository, or even the same branch, then just
share it via github_.

First fork NumPy into your account, as from :ref:`forking`.

Then, go to your forked repository github page, say
``http://github.com/your-user-name/numpy``

Click on the 'Admin' button, and add anyone else to the repo as a
collaborator:

   .. image:: pull_button.png

Now all those people can do::

    git clone git@githhub.com:your-user-name/numpy.git

Remember that links starting with ``git@`` use the ssh protocol and are
read-write; links starting with ``git://`` are read-only.

Your collaborators can then commit directly into that repo with the
usual::

     git commit -am 'ENH - much better code'
     git push origin master # pushes directly into your repo

Exploring your repository
=========================

To see a graphical representation of the repository branches and
commits::

   gitk --all

To see a linear list of commits for this branch::

   git log

You can also look at the `network graph visualizer`_ for your github_
repo.
