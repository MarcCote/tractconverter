"""
A setup.py script to use setuptools, which gives egg goodness, etc.

This is used to build installers for OS X through bdist_mpkg.

Notes
-----
Using ``python setupegg.py install`` directly results in file permissions being
set wrong, with nose refusing to run any tests. To run the tests anyway, use::

  >>> np.test(extra_argv=['--exe'])
